## PID & PPID

A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call getpid (man 2 getpid):

## getppid()
This method returns the id of the parent process, the id of the parent process will always be the same

## shell script that prints the maximum value a process id can be
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
```
